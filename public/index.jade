        h1.u-size10of12 Why is Company Culture important?
        p #[span.u-textRgEmB Company culture affects everyone and everything you do as a company.] Companies which understands the importance of company culture and have taken the opportunity to focus energy, time and resources have found major improvements in finances, recruiting, morale, motivation, customer service, leadership and retention just to mention a few.

        h2.u-marginBD2 So what is culture?
        p Company culture is the personality of an organisation.  This is displayed through the values, beliefs and standards to which a company works.  To really understand the culture of an organisation we look at the people who work within it.
        p As the personality of a person guides what they do, so the culture of a company is guided by what the people do.  This could be their attitudes, level of service to others, drivers and motivations, problem solving abilities, and their capacity to think outside the square and innovate. 
        p The culture of a company will determine the level of active engagement of the employees within the organisation.   All culture is driven by the leaders of the company.  Some may find it hard to do, resulting in poor culture.  Though, with persistent effort and commitment, leaders can make work an enjoyable experience for all.
        p So what kind of a culture does your organisation want?
